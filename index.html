      <h2  > List of Sonic the Hedgehog video games </h2> 
      <hr>
      <p>Sonic the Hedgehog is a video game series. It is published by Sega, with entries developed by Sega, Sonic Team, Dimps, SIMS Co., Ltd., BioWare, and Sumo Digital. The series debuted in 1991 with the video game, Sonic the Hedgehog, released for the Mega Drive video game console (named Sega Genesis in North America). Most Sonic the Hedgehog games have either been platform games or released for Sega video game consoles and handheld game consoles (handhelds) dating from the Sega Genesis to the eighth generation of video game consoles (2012â€“present). However, some of the original games were ported into versions on third-party home consoles and developed by several companies. As of March 2011, the series has collectively sold 89 million copies worldwide across both the platform games and spin-offs.

       
       
 Most of the games in the franchise are platform games, although the series also includes other genres such as racing video games, fighting games, action-adventure games, role-playing video games, and sports games. Each game focuses on the titular protagonist Sonic the Hedgehog, an anthropomorphic blue hedgehog. It also features a large cast of other characters such as Doctor Ivo "Eggman" Robotnik, Miles "Tails" Prower, Knuckles the Echidna, Amy Rose, Shadow the Hedgehog, and the Chao creatures.</p>
